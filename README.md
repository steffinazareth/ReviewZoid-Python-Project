# ReviewZoid : Python Project

This project was built as a part of the Data Focused Python course at Carnegie Mellon University.

Python was used as the programming language to build an application to provide clients with a onestop, centralized platform to gain a snapshot of their company and competitors, financially, among consumers, and in the media. To achieve this, we did the following:
1. Webscraping of product reviews, brand reviews and financial information using webscraping (BeautifulSoup and Selenium), API and RSS Feed. 
2. Presenting the user a chance to Analyse and review data through a host of functionalities. 
3. Enabling the user to compare financial metrics, output review data and view what's in the news. 

**To view and run the code, open the ReviewZoid.zip folder and follow the instructions in Readme pdf file.**
